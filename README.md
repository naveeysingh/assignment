# COMP2068 Assignment 1 - JS Frameworks

This repository contains the solution for **Assignment 1** of the **COMP2068: JavaScript Frameworks** course. The objective of this assignment is to practice creating and managing a basic Node.js application. 
The project also includes basic Git version control practices, where the code is committed and pushed to GitHub, with a focus on managing folders, `.gitkeep` files, and a `.gitignore` file for Node.js projects.
